### CPSC 120

Lab 7

Lab 7 part 1 was my favorite because it involves organizing where cars should park or not. 
I liked that it involved a lot of conditional statements which sort of creates a mini algorithm 
for the computer to follow. I also liked the fact, that during the process of making the program
I had to do some math to determine which numbers I needed to put in for the conditional statements. 

Lab 9

Lab 9 part 2 invovled two files that interact with eachother and that's what why it's one of my favorites.
This part of the lab is a game me and my partner made using the fstream library where one player inputs a 
secret number in the secret.cc file and the other player tries to guess the secret number in the game.cc file. 
If the player guesses the secret number correclty, they win and the program ends. 

Lab 11

This lab is my most favorite because it introduced to object oriented programming. I already have some 
coding experience in python prior to this lab, but this lab proved to be very challenging since I was
not very familiar to code this type of way. This lab gave me the opportunity to see what object oriented
programming consist of and I thought it was very neat.
